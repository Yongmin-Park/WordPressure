You will be provided with a word of seven letters or more which we'll call the "sourceword". You are then to think up three-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:

1. Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.
2. Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).
3. The words all have three letters or more.
4. There are no duplicate words in one level.
5. None of the typed words is the source word.
6. And don't forget: case is NOT significiant (Pet, PET, and pet are the *same* word).
